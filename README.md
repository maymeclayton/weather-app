This is a weather app created for Apax Software as part of their interview process.

### Requirements:
- prompts user location.
- displays current weather info about location.
- integrate weather source you feel comfortable with and explain why you selected that source.
- require user to sign-in (does not need to be full authentication, just ask for a username to track the user).
- user should be able to setup multiple locations to check weather.
- when app updates the weather info it should update each location.
- users and their locations should be stored in a database.
- commit code to GitHub and share with Apax team to review.

### Technologies:

**OpenWeather** - I chose this for my weather source because I had utilized it in a previous project, it's free, and fairly simple to implement.
